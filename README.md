# Halal Stock Checker
The Halal Stock Checker App is a web application that allows users to check whether a stock is halal (permissible under Islamic law) or haram (impermissible) based on various criteria, such as the industry classification and business practices of the company. The app uses the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve information about the stock, and limits the number of requests to 5 per minute to avoid overloading the API. Users can input the stock ticker symbol in the app's user interface, which features a clean and responsive design built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app outputs the result in real-time, indicating whether the stock is halal or haram, and provides feedback if the user tries to check too many stocks too quickly. The Halal Stock Checker App is a useful tool for Muslims and other investors who want to align their investments with their ethical and religious values.
